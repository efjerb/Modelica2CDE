# Modelica2CDE
A tool for parsing Modelica models to CDEs for simulation, analysis and documentation of building controls

The tool is heavily inspired by the [modelica-json](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-json) tool, but has been created in Python to increase usability to myself and other amateur coders.
